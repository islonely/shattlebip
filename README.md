# SHATTTLEBIP!
Play your favorite war ship game inside the terminal. Cross platform

## Roadmap
- [ ] Online Play (shattlebip without friends is no good; online play must come first)
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Custom Ship Placement (shouldn't be too difficult, but I'm lazy and placing ships randomly was quicker to write up some code for)
- [ ] Single Play (for wehn you crave shattlebip and need a fix on the road)

## Server
Navigate to the root of the repository.
Run the server with `v run server`.
> **NOTE**
> Right now the server defaults to "localhost:1902".
> The plan in the future is to add a config.toml and allow the user to configure this setting.

## Client
Navigate to he root of the repository.
Run the game with `v run client`.
